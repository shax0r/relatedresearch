The body's autonomic nervous system offers a feedback mechanism for the possible consequences of action choices.  For example, people may become nervous when driving fast around a bend, or when they are near a cliff edge.  These physiological changes are meant to protect oneself from danger.  

This paper uses a novel approach to reinforcement learning that leverages a task-independent intrinsic reward function trained on peripheral pulse measurements that are correlated with human autonomic nervous system responses.

The hypothesis is that these reward functions can improve sample efficiency and mitigate the challenges associated with sparse and skewed rewards in reinforcement learning.

The hypothesis is tested in a simulated driving environment.  

The results show that the reward function used in the simulated driving environment can increase the speed of learning and reduce the number of collisions during the learning stage.
